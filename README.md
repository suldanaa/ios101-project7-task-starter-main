## Notes

I didn't have much trouble with this project. I think it was a bit difficult at first to figure out how to make the data persist, but it was fairly straightforward to understand once I mapped everything out. The segue-ing was pretty easy too because it was similar to the lab. Overall, it was a straightforward assignment.
